my kind of approach for the problem
I guess this is very easy problem .
if you understand the secret of feature engineering it will be easy so that you will be attracted by all the feature given.
no missing values at all
very less preprocessing is required .
analysis point of view nice dataset to perfom eda.

Random forest gave high accuracy .
